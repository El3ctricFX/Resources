- Razer suggested to change the look of the [private app alternatives](https://electricproductions.pages.dev/Pages/resources/Production/resources/Techy%20Shit/os%20apps/1row) to just 2 columns and not 4 so i said why not and added both within a click of a button for people of perference or just different platforms.
