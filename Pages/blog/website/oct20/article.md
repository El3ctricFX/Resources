# What is this website trying to accomplish?

<font size="4">

So for this website i have a few things im trying to accomplish. <br>

The main thing is just to simply share resources no matter if its for production area's like videography or graphics or even drones to where i mainly special or even possibly web design, i may not be specialized in it but i believe that i have enough knowledge to share and thats the sole bases of this website is just to simply share what i learn and even better for you guys to also share and thats the reason i made the forms on the [Main Page](../../../../index.html) is that not just i can share resources but so we can all learn along the way as a community!

Another portion of this website is about Privacy & security,

Then theres the other major portion of it. The <a href="../../../../jesus.html" style="color: yellow">Jesus</a> tab! i know its not the best name so if anyone else has a better more descriptive name put it in the forms. But even just besides the name its important to know the creator of the world cause as soon as we die we will soon learn how close we truly were and if we really did want to be with God and the son for eternity so please go read the bible and read about the gospel what jesus has done for us all! Heres a few verses to start off with! [John 3:16 | Isaiah 41:10 | Proverbs 3:5-6]
