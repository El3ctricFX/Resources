# Isaiah 60

<font size="4">

Throughout this very morning while just waking up and getting ready for the day to start randomly Isaiah 60 appeared into my mind out of any chapter and verses it appears in my mind and by chance it says the following.



>1 Arise, shine;
For your light has come!
And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you.
2 
See, darkness covers the earth
    and thick darkness is over the peoples,
but the Lord rises upon you
    and his glory appears over you. <br>
3 
Nations will come to your light,
    and kings to the brightness of your dawn. <br>
4 
â€œLift up your eyes and look about you:
    All assemble and come to you;
your sons come from afar,
    and your daughters are carried on the hip. <br>
5 
Then you will look and be radiant,
    your heart will throb and swell with joy;
the wealth on the seas will be brought to you,
    to you the riches of the nations will come. <br>
6 
Herds of camels will cover your land,
    young camels of Midian and Ephah.
And all from Sheba will come,
    bearing gold and incense
    and proclaiming the praise of the Lord.
