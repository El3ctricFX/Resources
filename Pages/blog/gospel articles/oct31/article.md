# Halloween

<font size="4">


Just last night i had came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4eNSbCQ9M0) talking about the history of halloween and how it had become a holiday. and within the video linked above i had been reminded that it's a holiday that celebrates the dead, i believe i had already knew this but never realized how bad it was and within the video it talks about the dark history behind it. Please go watch the video to be aware of it. Then after that i had came across [this](https://youtu.be/6usUzhTENiA) video as well that discussed it the incase you wanna watch it and sense i was already watching video's of the sort i had also come across a [halloween warning from an ex-witch](https://youtu.be/PFAxuDApKD0) covering even more about the "holiday" 

becareful guys, be safe, god bless Amen!
