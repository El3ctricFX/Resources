    <p>As much as we love to fly drones and such theres still rules to folow so that being said, the first step to take is to take the TRUST (The Recreational UAS Safety Test) through a approved list of <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates">Suppliers</a> and if your wanting to go father then just Recreational flying (Personal Enjoyment) to maybe Commercial Flights (Flights including Payments) then you have to take your <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators">Part 107</a>. these should give you the basics of what to do such as like dont fly 400ft above the ground and use stuff like <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/b4ufly">B4UFLY</a> to ensure on the federal level your able to fly in selected locations and for the rest follow your local <a href="https://pilotinstitute.com/drones/states/">State Laws</a>.</p>


    <p> if you guys are wanting to fly in a restricted area you are able to request acccess through verified <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc">LAANC</a> applications.</p>

    <p>then theres the other half just dont fly near airports don't interfere with other flying aircraft ands such.</p>
