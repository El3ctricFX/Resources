When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent, you can go to the settings menu and disable personalized content. <b><font color="red">Like Edge it should be opt out.</font></b></li>
                      <li>Based on data such as IP address, hashed user ID, and your general location, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings.

                        As noted in our End User License Agreements and Terms of Service, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.
                        
                        We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically.</li>

  <p>You are also able to see more reasons to switch away on <a href="https://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman's Personal Site</a> ("What's bad about" Section)</p>
  
  <p>Some of these i used <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search's</a> Leo AI to summarize why we shouldnt use these products but then some is directly from the privacy policy so do a deeper dive your self and see the truth.</p> 



  <p>No matter if its security or privacy your looking for becareful with the provider check the privacy policies and the history and how they gain revenue and if it has anything to do with collecting information and advertising stay away from it and again no  matter if your doing it to get away from big tech or what so ever keep in mind a majority of these unencrypted servers can see your files / messages what ever it is... so guess what if they can see, attackers and malious people can to.</p>
